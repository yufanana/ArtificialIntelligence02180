# Assignment 1

Our group has chosen game Chinese Checkers as our game.

The GUI is adapted from [henrychess's repository](https://github.com/henrychess/pygame-chinese-checkers/).


## Installing with Anaconda

To create a new environment, with Python version 3.12, run:

```bash
conda create -n g7_ai1 python=3.12
```

To activate an environment, run:

```bash
conda activate g7_ai1
```

To install the Python packages, run:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the program

First, open a terminal and change to the directory containing `assignment1`.

The command on Linux/Mac should look like this:

```bash
# Linux/Mac
cd ~/ArtificialIntelligence02180/assignment1

# Windows
cd /d \ArtificialIntelligence02180\assignment1
```

To start the game, run:

```bash
conda activate g7_ai1
python main.py
```

The game will then prompt you to select players after clicking `Play`.

If you want to close the window, you can quit the game by clicking the X button on the top of the window or go to the terminal and press `Ctrl + C` or `cmd + C`.
